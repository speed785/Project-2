        <h3>Keyboard</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Every desktop needs a keyboard and this is an amazing design too! You won't need one unless you have
                    a touchscreen screen.
                </li>
            </ul>

                have a monitor with built in speakers if not separate!

    <h2><u>Desktop Parts</u></h2>
        <p>A little bit about the parts, The most expensive are the processor, graphics card, and ram at the moment,
            Ranging from $100 to $5000 depending on how high spec you want your system to be.
        </p>

        <h3>Motherboard</h3>
            <p>Think of this piece as the base camp of where all the pieces reside. The Motherboard is basically what holds your
                pieces together to allow them to interact.

        <h3>Power Supply</h3>
            <p>The power supply is the most important because without it, it won't turn on. A good power supply can handle
                high loads while also try to be energy efficient and not skyrocket your electric bill.
            </p>

        <h3>Processor</h3>
            <p>This is the main component to which we all know as the "brain" of the computer. It computes everything
                that you ask of it and it can either be slow or fast. I'm sure we've had experience with old processors.

        <h3>Graphics Card</h3>
            <p>Now you may have heard something about bitcoin in the news, well this is what people were after and let me
                tell you that they can be <strong>EXPENSIVE</strong>! Mostly it's to show you're screen and help with editing
                or playing video games.

        <h3>Hard Drive</h3>
            <p>For the Hard Drive, it depends on how fast you want it, but it's safe to have an ssd for booting and a Platter
                Drive for storing large quantities of items.
            </p>

        <h3>Desktop Case</h3>
            <p>This is where you can get away with saving money, but it's also where you can have the most fun in the end.</p>
            <p>To some, building a pc is an art that needs to be showcased and to others its just about the performance and
                just stashes the desktop away.
            </p>
