        <ul>
          <li>
            I've been to a lot of places in Chicago, constantly looking for new places to take photos to stand out as a
            photographer. I've been North, South, East, West you name it. I'll always be looking and taking more and more
            photos and with Chicago always busy as it is, so will I.

        <h2>Summary:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The best way to stand out is to showcase your work and for me, this is how I do it; with either photos or soon
            to be websites as portfolios.
          </li>
          <li>Thank you for coming! I hope that you have a nice day!</li>
